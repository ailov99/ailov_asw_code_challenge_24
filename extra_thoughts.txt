1. What changes you would make to this interfaces for use in an RTOS environment?
- Consider what happens if multiple tasks need to use the i2c bus. We would need to make it thread-safe by e.g. using a mutex or, more elaborately, having
a mediator interface on top of i2c.h where tasks can queue for i2c bus comms


2. How might the I2C API be improved?
- Add a timeout for both read and write in case we don't receive a SAK
- A more elaborate error code scheme
